# My super-simple editor 

Simple editor immune to page reloading. Created using [Webpack-starter](https://github.com/maciejkorsan/wtf-webpack-starter).

## How to use it?

Write your text, then if you wish to save it, click on SAVE button. If you wish to load previously saved text, just click on LOAD button (if previously saved content exists, it is shown on LOAD button by a little "i" icon).

## Webpack-starter options:

`npm run start` - runs development mode

`npm run build` - runs build process for production

`npm run publish` - runs build process and publish the page using `gh-pages` branch
